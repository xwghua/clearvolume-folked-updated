## Updates upon Dec.10, 2022
For those who have `'const float4 color'` OpenCL bugs in rendering volumes after installing the ClearVolume plugin via FijiImageJ update, here I uploaded an updated jar, so you only need to replace the original .jar file after the installation in the following path.

`<Fiji directory>/jars/clearvolume-1.4.2.jar`

Please don't forget to cite the original Github repository and paper in here: https://github.com/ClearVolume/clearvolume when you use the software.

## Introduction


ClearVolume is a real-time live 3D visualization library designed for high-end volumetric microscopes such as SPIM and DLSM microscopes. With ClearVolume you can see live on your screen the stacks acquired by your microscope instead of waiting for offline post-processing to give you an intuitive and comprehensive view on your data. The biologists can immediately decide whether a sample is worth imaging. 

ClearVolume can easily be integrated into existing Java, C/C++, Python, or LabVIEW based microscope software. Moreover, it has a dedicated interface to MicroManager/OpenSpim/OpenSpin control software. In addition, it offers the possibility of remote viewing of volume data
